TravelDash is a application for creating web and mobile dashboards for public transport. Basically,
showing when my next buses or trains will depart. Put it on your phone, in a background tab, or on
the wall of your office.

TravelDash was created for the 2011 New Zealand [Mix & Mash](http://www.mixandmash.org.nz)
Competition. It was inspired by the (Panic Status Board)[http://www.panic.com/blog/2010/03/the-panic-status-board/].
